## Local Hack Day
This was my first local hack day, and while it was far quieter than any hack I'd been to before, it was just as fun. I was
surprised to discover that it was very workshop based, hence why the hack produced is somewhat small and incomplete.

I partnered with @Selina-Jane (it was her first hack) and together we made a basic Python program that aims to alter the tone
of voice in a string, based on a dictionary provided by the user.
